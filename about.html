    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <div class="intro">
      <p>I’m Boyue Du, an electrical engineer passionate about intelligent electronics, power systems, and their applications in the automotive industry. I recently earned my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where I developed advanced knowledge and hands-on experience in signal processing, machine learning, and applied physics. In Fall 2025, I will begin my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCLA, focusing on power system design and automotive innovation. </p>

      <p>In my undergraduate life, curiosity led me to find my career path: engineering. Despite the challenging courses and heavy workload, I found joy in this process. Every night, when I walked tiredly to my dorm from Memorial Library, I felt enriched because I had learned something I didn't know before. Whenever I encountered elegant formulas derived by scientists like Fourier and Maxwell, whom I admired in childhood, I realized I was doing something meaningful. When I learned how engine and transmission operate in a car, I felt I moved closer to my goal. Curiosity and interest drove me to go forward. </p>

      <p>In June 2023, during a break from school, I launched my own startup: 从知书院 (Congzhi), a Chinese-style multifunctional space that blends drinks, dining, music, literature, and bar culture together. Designed to attract young urban professionals, the space was more than a café—it was a hub for creativity and conversation. I managed everything from branding and interior design to kitchen operations. This entrepreneurial journey taught me how to transform ideas into real-world value and strengthened my belief in the power of interdisciplinary thinking. </p>

      <p>On my first day as a freshman at UW–Madison, I saw the words engraved on a railing at Alumni Park: “Make your mark on the world.” Four years later, I haven’t changed my goal—only deepened my understanding of what it means. Now, with a foundation built on curiosity, perseverance, and purpose, I’m ready to leave that mark—through engineering, innovation, and impact.</p>
